## 🏗️ Database Setup Ritual

1. Summon your database (PostgreSQL):  
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE artimes_db;
   ```

2. Whisper your secrets into `artimes/settings.py`:  
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'artimes_db',
           'USER': 'your_db_username',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '5432',
       }
   }
   ```

3. Forge the initial tables:  
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
